* Description

  In this part, you will create a relational database for your
  application. This includes the creation of your database in Oracle
  and the loading of data into the database. Specifically, your need
  to do the following.

  1. Learn to Use Oracle

     You need to get familiar with Oracle SQL*PLUS environment. You
     may want to login to SQL*PLUS, learn to use various commands, try
     out online help, and read on-line documents.

  2. Refine Relational Schema
     
     Before creating the database, you need to refine the relational
     schema of your database based on my feedback on your Part Two of
     the project.

  3. Define schema in Oracle 

     You will convert the refined relational schema into SQL
     statements that create tables. You need to decide SQL types for
     attributes and constraints for tables and for columns. Here are
     some specific requirements.

    1. You should use various Oracle data types in your
       tables. Specifically, you should have at least one attribute in
       each of the following types: integer, real, character string of
       fixed length, character string of a variable length, date,
       sequence, and enumerated values (using a set).

    2. Both table constraints and column constraints should be
       specified. In addition, you should define at least one object
       type, and one CHECK constraint.

    3. You should specify primary and foreign keys.

  You should keep these SQL DDL statements in a .sql script file, and
  run it from within SQL*PLUS to create tables.

  4. Load data to your database

  You should use Oracle SQL*LOADER to populate tables with your
  application data. You should provide enough data so that complex
  queries will not always result in empty answers. As a guideline,
  each table should have about 40 to 50 tuples. For those tables that
  likely to be involved in multi-table SQL queries for your
  application, make sure that tuples in different tables will actually
  join. You do not need to worry about tables that are inherently
  small. You do not have to make tables really big at this time, you
  can always add more data in future.

* What to Hand In

  Hand in a hard copy report that contains the following items.

  1. Revised Report of Part Two
     
  Again, include a fresh copy of the revised report of Part Two. Make
  sure to include reports for Part One and Two with all the
  revisions. (So that the current report gives a snapshot of the
  current status of the project) .

  2. SQL Scripts

  Include a hard copy of SQL script files that you use to create
  domains, tables, views, and sequences, and also SQL*LOADER control
  files that you use to load your data. (Do not include the data
  file.)

  3. Spool File

  Include a spool file that illustrate a session in which you
  successfully created your database and loaded the data into your
  database. Please do not hand in pages after pages of data.

  4. Special Note

  Include a special note to describe any business rule in the
  application domain that can not be directly specified in the SQL
  database schema.
